                    Beginnings
                </h2>
                <p>Ford GT wasn't really Ford. The first GTs were built by Lola, a company in the 1960s. Ford bought several for the Le Mans. In, 1965, Carroll Shelby began to develop the Lola GT's into a better car. They called GT40, for its 40 inch height. They failed miserably, the gear boxes, suspension, etc. failing under endurance problems. Then Shelby, a retired Le Mans racer came and helped make the GT. In 1965, Ken Miles came into the project. The did major airflow improvements, added fiberglass, and, surprisingly added a larger 7-liter, 427 ci engine. They still failed, however. Next year, they made more improvements and finally won the Le Mans. They are the only American company to have ever won Le Mans.

                <p>
                    The Ford GT uses carbon-ceramic disk brakes. This high performance material, made from a special mixture of powders, resins and fibers in a complex manufacturing process, has been used since the 1970s in braking systems for aerospace applications and since the 1980s in motorsports.

                <p>
                    The Ford GT (current) uses a twin turbocharged V6 3.5 liter intercooled engine. The 3.5L EcoBoost is direct-injected and turbocharged engine first introduced in 2007 under the name TwinForce. The main idea behind this power unit was the creation of a solid alternative to a large-displacement V8 engine such as the V8 coyote sourced engine. This was used in cars like the Ford Mustang GT. The new turbocharged 3.5L V6 engine provides equivalent power and torque to a naturally aspirated 6.0L V8 with less fuel consumption and emissions of harmful substances.
