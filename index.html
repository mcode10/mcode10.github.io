        What is this site?
    </h1>
    <p>
        I want to mess around with site-building and CSS Grid. So, I decided to make a Git and Github tutorial to get you started. As I post new things (A.K.A new tutorials), you and I will both learn some new stuff. Enjoy!
    </p>
    <p>
        P.S. I am dedicating this site to my dad. I hope this tutorial helps him.

    <p>
        P.P.S My apologies for the massive logo. I'll figure that out later, once I have most of the main content.
