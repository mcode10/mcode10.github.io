        Terminal n-n-n-inja time!

        Teach me, master. Very well. The first step on your journey is learning how to move around in the terminal. It is helpful to have a file browsing app open at this time, such as Finder on Mac. There are a few basic commands to show where you are, the files at your location, and move through your folders. Note that from here on out, vocabulary words will be surrounded in these ||. An example would be path, found below. I have a seperate page for the definitions of these words.

        1. <code>pwd</code>- This command shows you your |path|.
