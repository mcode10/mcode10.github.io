        Terminal n-n-n-inja time!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Teach me, master. Very well. The first step on your journey is learning how to move around in the terminal. It is helpful to have a file browsing app open at this time, such as Finder on Mac. There are a few basic commands to show where you are, the files at your location, and move through your folders. Note that from here on out, vocabulary words will be hyperlinked to their definition and italic. An example would be path, found below. I have a seperate page for the definitions of these words.
    </p>
    <p>
        1. <code>pwd</code>- This command shows you your <a href="./Vocab.html#Path">path</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. <code>cd [directory]</code>- Within the <a href="./Vocab.html#Directory">directory</a> you are in now, you can drop into sub-directories.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. <code>cd ..</code>- You can go up one folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. <code>ls</code>- This tells you what files are in your current directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. <code>ls -la</code>- This lists all the files in your current directory, and shows the <a href="./Vocab.html#Permissions">permissions.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally, these 5 commands will be enough to help manuver you around your files. Now, students, please open your terminal, or <a href="./Vocab.html#Shell">shell</a> application.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first few lines should look like this: <code>Last login: Sat MMM xx xx:xx:xx on ttys000
            mbp:~ [username]$ </code> Obviously, it won't always be Saturday, but you get the point. Hopefully. Now, students, type in <code>ls</code>. Some things that should show up are your Documents folder, Applications, and Downloads. If you don't get that, but get some similar items, it is all <i>okay</i>.
