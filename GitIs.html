        What in the name of this world is Git!? And, what's Github?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Well, my friends, Git is what developers like to call source-code-managment. We also call it SCM, for short. Okay, I git (pun intended) that. That still doesn't answer my question though. Alright, alright, I'll answer your question. Developers #1 fear is losing code, or messing it up so bad, that you do not know how to fix it again. So, with SCM, there's always a back-up, so you don't have to worry about that. Github is basically Git, but online, and has some extra cool features. The next page will talk about how to use Git and Github.
