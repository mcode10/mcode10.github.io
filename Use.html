        How do I do use Git and Github?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Using Github is simple. All you do is create an account, and the buttons on Github will guide you most of the way. The hard part, though is Git. For Git, you need access to the terminal, or command-line. This is where if you are on Windows, you are out of luck. I am not sure how the Dos Shell works. However, you may be able to git (pun-intended again) away with using the Linux subsystem. I digress, though.

        Now, a command-line is an app with no graphics, unless you count text. Commands will be written like this example <code>cd ..</code>.

        Commands will be tricky to learn, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be just typing away on the terminal.
